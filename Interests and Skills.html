                    <strong>Fotografi</strong><br>
                    Through shadows and light, I capture emotions that words cannot express. 
                    Dark and light photography is not just about contrast — it’s about balance, mystery, and depth.
                    Every frame tells a silent story, where darkness highlights the beauty of light, and light gives meaning to the shadows..

                    <strong>Expressing the Soul Through Art</strong><br>
                    I have a strong passion for the arts, especially in expressing myself through performance and music. 
                    As someone who enjoys both acting and singing, I find true happiness in combining them to tell meaningful stories.
                    Performing arts allow me to connect emotionally with others — through facial expressions, body language, and vocal harmony. 
                    Acting brings characters to life, while choral singing adds emotional depth to every moment.
                    The blend of these two art forms not only enriches my creativity but also strengthens my confidence, teamwork, and empathy.
                    For me, it’s more than just a hobby — it’s a part of who I am.
